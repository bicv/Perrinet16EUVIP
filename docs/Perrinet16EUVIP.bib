abstract = {The Hurst parameter for two-dimensional (2-D) fractional Brownian motion (fBm) provides a single number that completely characterizes isotropic textured surfaces whose roughness is scale-invariant. Extended self-similar (ESS) processes were previously introduced in order to provide a generalization of fBm. These new processes are described by a number of multiscale Hurst parameters. In contrast to the single Hurst parameter, the extended parameters are able to characterize a greater variety of natural textures where the roughness of these textures is not necessarily scale-invariant. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of multiscale Hurst parameters as features for texture classification and segmentation. For texture classification, the performance of the generalized Hurst features is compared to traditional Hurst and Gabor features. Our experiments show that classification accuracy for the generalized Hurst and Gabor features are comparable even though the generalized Hurst features lower the dimensionality by a factor of five. Next, the segmentation accuracy using generalized and standard Hurst features is evaluated on images of texture mosaics. For these experiments, the performance is evaluated with and without supplemental contrast and average grayscale features. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of the Hurst features to segment real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.},

	Abstract = {Abstract--- {M}eanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popu- lar image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation in- variance due to the aliasing between subbands. {T}hese transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. {A}t the same time their optimization get a challenging task. {W}e proposed here a log-{G}abor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the {G}abor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. {T}wo major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. {A}nd second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). {T}he transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the {P}rimary {V}isual {C}ortex ({V}1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. {C}ompared to the state of the art, the log-{G}abor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent {G}aussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. {S}uch characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

@article{Geisler01,
	Abstract = {The human brain manages to correctly interpret almost every visual image it receives from the environment. Underlying this ability are contour grouping mechanisms that appropriately link local edge elements into global contours. Although a general view of how the brain achieves effective contour grouping has emerged, there have been a number of different specific proposals and few successes at quantitatively predicting performance. These previous proposals have been developed largely by intuition and computational trial and error. A more principled approach is to begin with an examination of the statistical properties of contours that exist in natural images, because it is these statistics that drove the evolution of the grouping mechanisms. Here we report measurements of both absolute and Bayesian edge co-occurrence statistics in natural images, as well as human performance for detecting natural-shaped contours in complex backgrounds. We find that contour detection performance is quantitatively predicted by a local grouping rule derived directly from the co-occurrence statistics, in combination with a very simple integration rule (a transitivity rule) that links the locally grouped contour elements into longer contours.},

@article{Olshausen97,
	Abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images (Olshausen and Field, 1996a). Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete---i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output fun...},

@article{Perrinet03ieee,
	Abstract = {To understand possible strategies of temporal spike coding in the central nervous system, we study functional neuromimetic models of visual processing for static images. We will first present the retinal model which was introduced by Van Rullen and Thorpe [1] and which represents the multi- scale contrast values of the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary ---and possibly non-orthogonal--- representations of features in the images. In particular, we compared the perfor- mance of increasingly over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing which may adapt to the complexity of the visual input.},

The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular, the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

@article{Kremkow16,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex are known for responding vigorously but with high variability to classical stimuli such as drifting bars or gratings. By contrast, natural scenes are encoded more efficiently by sparse and temporal precise spiking responses. We used a conductance-based model of the visual system in higher mammals to investigate how two specific features of the thalamo-cortical pathway, namely push-pull receptive field organization and synaptic depression, can contribute to this contextual reshaping of V1 responses. By comparing cortical dynamics evoked respectively by natural vs. artificial stimuli in a comprehensive parametric space analysis, we demonstrate that the reliability and sparseness of the spiking responses during natural vision is not a mere consequence of the increased bandwidth in the sensory input spectrum. Rather, it results from the combined impacts of synaptic depression and push-pull inhibition, the later acting for natural scenes as a form of ``effective'' feed-forward inhibition as demonstrated in other sensory systems. Thus, the combination of feedforward-like inhibition with fast thalamo-cortical synaptic depression by simple cells receiving a direct structured input from thalamus composes a generic computational mechanism for generating a sparse and reliable encoding of natural sensory events.},

@article{Kreuz2013,
	Abstract = {Recently, the SPIKE-distance has been proposed as a parameter-free and timescale-independent measure of spike train synchrony. This measure is time resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for eventlike firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement of this measure that eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as well as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.},

	Abstract = {The concept of feature selectivity in sensory signal processing can be formalized as dimensionality reduction: in a stimulus space of very high dimensions, neurons respond only to variations within some smaller, relevant subspace. But if neural responses exhibit invariances, then the relevant subspace typically cannot be reached by a Euclidean projection of the original stimulus. We argue that, in several cases, we can make progress by appealing to the simplest nonlinear construction, identifying the relevant variables as quadratic forms, or "stimulus energies." Natural examples include non-phase-locked cells in the auditory system, complex cells in the visual cortex, and motion-sensitive neurons in the visual system. Generalizing the idea of maximally informative dimensions, we show that one can search for kernels of the relevant quadratic forms by maximizing the mutual information between the stimulus energy and the arrival times of action potentials. Simple implementations of this idea successfully recover the underlying properties of model neurons even when the number of parameters in the kernel is comparable to the number of action potentials and stimuli are completely natural. We explore several generalizations that allow us to incorporate plausible structure into the kernel and thereby restrict the number of parameters. We hope that this approach will add significantly to the set of tools available for the analysis of neural responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli.},

@article{Fournier11,
	Abstract = {Receptive fields in primary visual cortex (V1) are categorized as simple or complex, depending on their spatial selectivity to stimulus contrast polarity. We studied the dependence of this classification on visual context by comparing, in the same cell, the synaptic responses to three classical receptive field mapping protocols: sparse noise, ternary dense noise and flashed Gabor noise. Intracellular recordings revealed that the relative weights of simple-like and complex-like receptive field components were scaled so as to make the same receptive field more simple-like with dense noise stimulation and more complex-like with sparse or Gabor noise stimulations. However, once these context-dependent receptive fields were convolved with the corresponding stimulus, the balance between simple-like and complex-like contributions to the synaptic responses appeared to be invariant across input statistics. This normalization of the linear/nonlinear input ratio suggests a previously unknown form of homeostatic control of V1 functional properties, optimizing the network nonlinearities to the statistical structure of the visual input.},

@article{Perrinet10shl,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism which optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair: By contributing to optimize statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

Here, we describe a framework to generate random texture movies with controlled information content, i.e., Motion Clouds. These stimuli are defined using a generative model that is based on controlled experimental parametrization. We show that Motion Clouds correspond to dense mixing of localized moving gratings with random positions. Their global envelope is similar to natural-like stimulation with an approximate full-field translation corresponding to a retinal slip. We describe the construction of these stimuli mathematically and propose an open-source Python-based implementation. Examples of the use of this framework are shown. We also propose extensions to other modalities such as color vision, touch, and audition.},

	Abstract = {Abstract--- {M}eanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popular image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation in- variance due to the aliasing between subbands. {T}hese transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. {A}t the same time their optimization get a challenging task. {W}e proposed here a log-{G}abor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the {G}abor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. {T}wo major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. {A}nd second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). {T}he transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the {P}rimary {V}isual {C}ortex ({V}1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. {C}ompared to the state of the art, the log-{G}abor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent {G}aussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. {S}uch characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

	Abstract = {Sensory neurons have been hypothesized to efficiently encode signals from the natural environment subject to resource constraints. The predictions of this efficient coding hypothesis regarding the spatial filtering properties of the visual system have been found consistent with human perception, but they have not been compared directly with neural responses. Here, we analyze the information that retinal ganglion cells transmit to the brain about the spatial information in natural images subject to three resource constraints: the number of retinal ganglion cells, their total response variances, and their total synaptic strengths. We derive a model that optimizes the transmitted information and compare it directly with measurements of complete functional connectivity between cone photoreceptors and the four major types of ganglion cells in the primate retina, obtained at single-cell resolution. We find that the ganglion cell population exhibited 80{\%} efficiency in transmitting spatial information relative to the model. Both the retina and the model exhibited high redundancy ({\~{}}30{\%}) among ganglion cells of the same cell type. A novel and unique prediction of efficient coding, the relationships between projection patterns of individual cones to all ganglion cells, was consistent with the observed projection patterns in the retina. These results indicate a high level of efficiency with near-optimal redundancy in visual signaling by the retina.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have examined the temporal precision of spiking in visual system neurons, but less is known about the time scale that is relevant for behaviorally important visual computations. We examined how spatiotemporal patterns of spikes in ensembles of primate retinal ganglion cells convey information about visual motion to the brain. The direction of motion of a bar was estimated by comparing the timing of responses in ensembles of parasol (magnocellular-projecting) retinal ganglion cells recorded simultaneously, using a cross-correlation approach similar to standard models of motion sensing. To identify the temporal resolution of motion signals, spike trains were low-pass filtered before estimating the direction of motion. The filter time constant that resulted in most accurate motion sensing was in the range of 10-50 msec for a range of stimulus speeds and contrasts and approached a lower limit of approximately 10 msec at high speeds and contrasts. This time constant was, on average, comparable to the length of interspike intervals. These findings suggest that cortical neurons could filter their inputs on a time scale of tens of milliseconds, rather than relying on the precise times of individual input spikes, to sense motion most reliably.},

	Abstract = {Robust coding has been proposed as a solution to the problem of minimizing decoding error in the presence of neural noise. Many real-world problems, however, have degradation in the input signal, not just in neural representations. This generalized problem is more relevant to biological sensory coding where internal noise arises from limited neural precision and external noise from distortion of sensory signal such as blurring and phototransduction noise. In this note, we show that the optimal linear encoder for this problem can be decomposed exactly into two serial processes that can be optimized separately. One is Wiener filtering, which optimally compensates for input degradation. The other is robust coding, which best uses the available representational capacity for signal transmission with a noisy population of linear neurons. We also present spectral analysis of the decomposition that characterizes how the reconstruction error is minimized under different input signal spectra, types and amounts of degradation, degrees of neural precision, and neural population sizes.},

@article{Doi14,
	Abstract = {A fundamental task of a sensory system is to infer information about the environment. It has long been suggested that an important goal of the first stage of this process is to encode the raw sensory signal efficiently by reducing its redundancy in the neural representation. Some redundancy, however, would be expected because it can provide robustness to noise inherent in the system. Encoding the raw sensory signal itself is also problematic, because it contains distortion and noise. The optimal solution would be constrained further by limited biological resources. Here, we analyze a simple theoretical model that incorporates these key aspects of sensory coding, and apply it to conditions in the retina. The model specifies the optimal way to incorporate redundancy in a population of noisy neurons, while also optimally compensating for sensory distortion and noise. Importantly, it allows an arbitrary input-to-output cell ratio between sensory units (photoreceptors) and encoding units (retinal ganglion cells), providing predictions of retinal codes at different eccentricities. Compared to earlier models based on redundancy reduction, the proposed model conveys more information about the original signal. Interestingly, redundancy reduction can be near-optimal when the number of encoding units is limited, such as in the peripheral retina. We show that there exist multiple, equally-optimal solutions whose receptive field structure and organization vary significantly. Among these, the one which maximizes the spatial locality of the computation, but not the sparsity of either synaptic weights or neural responses, is consistent with known basic properties of retinal receptive fields. The model further predicts that receptive field structure changes less with light adaptation at higher input-to-output cell ratios, such as in the periphery. Studies of the computational principles of sensory coding have largely focused on the redundancy reduction hypothesis, which posits that a neural population should encode the raw sensory signal efficiently by reducing its redundancy. Models based on this idea, however, have not taken into account some important aspects of sensory systems. First, neurons are noisy, and therefore, some redundancy in the code can be useful for transmitting information reliably. Second, the sensory signal itself is noisy, which should be counteracted as early as possible in the sensory pathway. Finally, neural resources such as the number of neurons are limited, which should strongly affect the form of the sensory code. Here we examine a simple model that takes all these factors into account. We find that the model conveys more information compared to redundancy reduction. When applied to the retina, the model provides a unified functional account for several known properties of retinal coding and makes novel predictions that have yet to be tested experimentally. The generality of the framework allows it to model a wide range of conditions and can be applied to predict optimal sensory coding in other systems.},

	Abstract = {A flash of light evokes neural activity in the brain with a delay of 30-100 milliseconds, much of which is due to the slow process of visual transduction in photoreceptors. A moving object can cover a considerable distance in this time, and should therefore be seen noticeably behind its actual location. As this conflicts with everyday experience, it has been suggested that the visual cortex uses the delayed visual data from the eye to extrapolate the trajectory of a moving object, so that it is perceived at its actual location. Here we report that such anticipation of moving stimuli begins in the retina. A moving bar elicits a moving wave of spiking activity in the population of retinal ganglion cells. Rather than lagging behind the visual image, the population activity travels near the leading edge of the moving bar. This response is observed over a wide range of speeds and apparently compensates for the visual response latency. We show how this anticipation follows from known mechanisms of retinal processing.},

	Abstract = {Our perception of the environment relies on the capacity of neural networks to adapt rapidly to changes in incoming stimuli. It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive, that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli. Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour. Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding, yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation (on the timescale of visual fixation) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque (Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex (V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post-adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus-dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation. Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.},

	Abstract = {Potential strategies for temporal neural processing in the brain and their implications for the design of artificial neural networks are considered. Current connectionist thinking holds that neurons send signals to each other by changes in their average rate of discharge. This implies that there is one output signal per neuron at any given time (scalar coding), and that all neuronal specificity is achieved solely by patterns of synaptic connections. However, information can be carried by temporal codes, in temporal patterns of neural discharges and by relative times of arrival of individual spikes. Temporal coding permits multiplexing of information in the time domain, which potentially increases the flexibility of neural networks. A broadcast model of information transmission is contrasted with the current notion of highly specific connectivity. Evidence for temporal coding in somatoception, audition, electroception, gustation, olfaction and vision is reviewed, and possible neural architectures for temporal information processing are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the mechanism underlying distributed neural coding is a fundamental goal in computational neuroscience. With the ability to simultaneously observe the activity of large networks of neurons in response to external stimuli, a natural question arises: how the outside world is represented in the collective activity of these neurons? In this work, we provide an information theoretic approach for determining the role of cooperation among neurons in encoding external stimuli. Specifically, we show that statistical independence between neuronal outputs may not provide the best coding strategy when these outputs depend on the history of other neuronal constituents in the network. Rather, cooperation among neurons can provide a near optimal and lossless coding strategy under specific constraints governing their network structure. Using a statistical learning model, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in decoding a motor task with both discrete targets and continuous trajectory using spike trains from a small subset of a large network. We demonstrate its superiority in minimizing the decoding error compared to a statistically independent model and to other classical decoders reported in the literature.},

Both rely on the use of stochastic stimuli, and both assume a response model with an initial linear stage that serves to reduce the dimensionality of the stimulus space. They differ primarily in their description of spike generation: One family of methods assumes an inhomogeneous Poisson model for spike generation, and the other assumes a generalized form of integrate-and-fire model. We show simulated examples to illustrate procedures for estimation of model parameters from data and discuss the constraints on stimulus design and convergence as a function of the amount of data collected.},

	Abstract = {We compute the exact spike-triggered average (STA) of the voltage for the nonleaky integrate-and-fire (IF) cell in continuous time, driven by gaussian white noise. The computation is based on techniques from the theory of renewal processes and continuous-time hidden Markov processes (e.g., the backward and forward Fokker-Planck partial differential equations associated with first-passage time densities). From the STA voltage, it is straightforward to derive the STA input current. The theory also gives an explicit asymptotic approximation for the STA of the leaky IF cell, valid in the low-noise regime sigma --{\textgreater} 0. We consider both the STA and the conditional average voltage given an observed spike "doublet" event, that is, two spikes separated by some fixed period of silence. In each case, we find that the STA as a function of time-preceding-spike, tau, has a square root singularity as tau approaches zero from below and scales linearly with the scale of injected noise current. We close by briefly examining the discrete-time case, where similar phenomena are observed.},

@article{Nath2016,
	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Orientation selectivity (OS) is a prominent and well studied feature of early visual processing in mammals, but recent work has highlighted the possibility that parallel OS circuits might exist in multiple brain locations. Although both classic and modern work has identified an OS mechanism in selective wiring from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to primary visual cortex, OS responses have now been found upstream of cortex in mouse LGN and superior colliculus, suggesting a possible origin in the retina. Indeed, retinal OS responses have been reported for decades in rabbit and more recently in mouse. However, we still know very little about the properties and mechanisms of retinal OS in the mouse, including whether there is a distinct OS ganglion cell type, which orientations are represented, and what are the synaptic mechanisms of retinal OS. We have identified two novel types of OS ganglion cells in the mouse retina that are highly selective for horizontal and vertical cardinal orientations. Reconstructions of the dendritic trees of these OS ganglion cells and measurements of their synaptic conductances offer insights into the mechanism of the OS computation at the earliest stage of the visual system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Orientation selectivity (OS) is one of the most well studied computations in the brain and has become a prominent model system in various areas of sensory neuroscience. Although the cortical mechanism of OS suggested by Hubel and Wiesel (1962) has been investigated intensely, other OS cells exist upstream of cortex as early as the retina and the mechanisms of OS in subcortical regions are much less well understood. We identified two ON retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in mouse that compute OS along the horizontal (nasal-temporal) and vertical (dorsoventral) axes of visual space. We show the relationship between dendritic morphology and OS for each RGC type and reveal new synaptic mechanisms of OS computation in the retina.},

@article{Venkataramani2016,
	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Neurons that signal the orientation of edges within the visual field have been widely studied in primary visual cortex. Much less is known about the mechanisms of orientation selectivity that arise earlier in the visual stream. Here we examine the synaptic and morphological properties of a subtype of orientation-selective ganglion cell in the rabbit retina. The receptive field has an excitatory ON center, flanked by excitatory OFF regions, a structure similar to simple cell receptive fields in primary visual cortex. Examination of the light-evoked postsynaptic currents in these ON-type orientation-selective ganglion cells (ON-OSGCs) reveals that synaptic input is mediated almost exclusively through the ON pathway. Orientation selectivity is generated by larger excitation for preferred relative to orthogonal stimuli, and conversely larger inhibition for orthogonal relative to preferred stimuli. Excitatory orientation selectivity arises in part from the morphology of the dendritic arbors. Blocking GABAA receptors reduces orientation selectivity of the inhibitory synaptic inputs and the spiking responses. Negative contrast stimuli in the flanking regions produce orientation-selective excitation in part by disinhibition of a tonic NMDA receptor-mediated input arising from ON bipolar cells. Comparison with earlier studies of OFF-type OSGCs indicates that diverse synaptic circuits have evolved in the retina to detect the orientation of edges in the visual input.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A core goal for visual neuroscientists is to understand how neural circuits at each stage of the visual system extract and encode features from the visual scene. This study documents a novel type of orientation-selective ganglion cell in the retina and shows that the receptive field structure is remarkably similar to that of simple cells in primary visual cortex. However, the data indicate that, unlike in the cortex, orientation selectivity in the retina depends on the activity of inhibitory interneurons. The results further reveal the physiological basis for feature detection in the visual system, elucidate the synaptic mechanisms that generate orientation selectivity at an early stage of visual processing, and illustrate a novel role for NMDA receptors in retinal processing.},

@article{Sharpee2004a,
	Abstract = {We propose a method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli that are nongaussian and exhibit strong correlations. We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high-dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low-dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.},
